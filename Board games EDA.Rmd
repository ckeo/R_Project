```{r}

ratings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/ratings.csv')
details <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/details.csv')

head(details)
head(ratings)

ratings %>%
  arrange(desc(bayes_average))
```

My initial questions are...
Which game has the highest average?

General questions:
what is bayes average?
do i need to get rid of the []s in my data probably. am i even gonna use those cols tho.
